<h2> The Best of Aladdin </h2>
<p> <strong> Aladdin </strong> is a very classic and beautiful Disney movie that allows girls from the Middle East and South Asia to feel represented on the big screen. The movie shows a strong female lead who believes in love and wants to prove to her father that certain rules and societal pressures regarding marriage are not applicable to all, which is a very strong message to send. It is an incredible movie especially for the youth from the Middle East and South Asia as there are many arranged or forced marriages which might work for everyone. The movie also teaches about how people need to have a giving and compassionate attitude even if you think that you are in a bad situation. Aladdin gives to homeless children despite him also being in need. It also shows how good people are rewarded in the end for their good deeds as Aladdin ended up with Jasmine and lived in a nice and big palace with the ability to give back even more.

<h2> The Worst of Aladdin </h2>
<p> While <strong> Aladdin </strong> is classic, it does have certain controversial and wrong aspects to it. <strong> Aladdin </strong> is a middle eastern folk tale that date back to at least the 10th century. It derives from the story from the <strong> Arabian Nights </strong>. However, Disney added different cultural aspects from other areas in the world to the story to romanticize it and this causes lots of confusion for viewers. Its origins are hard to pin down, as the version of the tale are found in North African, Arabic, Turkish, Persian, Indian cultures. In addition, it has a weak Jafar character in the newer version of the movie. As a character, Aladdin is reliant on Jafar to move his story along as it's Jafar who must convince Aladdin to enter the cave of wonders that his prize will be worth all the effort and commitment to getting the lamp. </p>
